These files are supplementary materials for "Higher-order differential attack on reduced-round SLIM".
1. HOD
 The source code "main.c" is used for searching Higher-order differential characteristics.
 
2. BDP
 The source codes are used for Integral characteristics applying Bit-based division property. 
 2.1 slim_functions.py
 2.2 slim_lp.py
  These two files are used to generate lp-file for gurobi.
  When we execute "slim_lp.py", the lp-file named "slim.lp" is generated.
 2.3 main.py
 2.4 slim.py
  These two files are used to execute "slim.lp".
